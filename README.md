# My Portfolio

Below are examples of my work in ArcGIS, Archaeology, Databases and more.

## Cartography and Spatial Analysis in ArcGIS
### B/W Maps 
This map was produced for a publication that demanded complex data in b/w format. Three data frames are used to locate the study area (bottom) and display the main features at the local (centre) and regional (top) levels.

### Integrating DEMs
A simple map of the region of Nasca, Peru incorporating a DEM downloaded from INGEMMET (Peru). Inset uses data from the same source but represents political administrative units.

### Landsat 7 images
This map is based on Landsat 7 imagery with reassigned bands (band combination 4, 3, 2) to show the vegetation's extent (in red) in the Nasca area.

### Feature digitisation and Classification
This map shows features from an excavation in Peru. Most features were directly mapped in the field using a GPS/Total Station, the data was stored in a data collector and then transferred to Autocad. Others were digitised from ortho-mosaics produced in the field. Later, features were imported into ArcGIS. In addition, features were classified by field values (i.e., function).

### Llama (*Llama glama*) GIS
This illustration shows the ubiquity of llama bones in the excavations of Huayuri. The llama skeleton is a Llama GIS where each skeletal specimen (i.e., bone) appears black if the record is NOT NULL. In addition, this illustration is an example of the deployment of five data frames simultaneously.

### DEM display and HILLSHADE
A topographic map of Huayuri archaeological site (Peru). The elevation model was built from points taken directly in the field with a Total Station. “Lines” illustrating walls were created by digitising an Ortho-mosaic (architecture) into ArcGIS. The display of the topography is achieved using two superimposed layers. The top layer is the original DEM with transparency ca. 40%, and the bottom one is a DEM processed using the HILLSHADE tool.

### Ortho-mosaics and digitised features
The central data frame displays an ortho-mosaic created in PCI Geomatica using 5MP images taken from an ultralight plane during a low-height flight. Ground points were used to georeferenced the final image. The other data frames show the location of the main frame in the ravine where the site is found (left) and the location of excavation units (right)

### TIN creation
A  TIN was created in ArcGIS using the centre  of postholes as vertices to determine the possible length of beams in the roof. Polygons representing postholes were created by georeferencing paper drawings and georeferencing using ground points.
