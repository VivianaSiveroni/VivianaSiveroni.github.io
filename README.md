# My Portfolio

Below,there are examples of my work in ArcGIS, Archaeology, Databases and more.

## Cartography and Spatial Analysis in ArcGIS
### B/W Maps 
This map was produced for a publication that demanded complex data in b/w format. Three data frames are used to locate the study area (bottom), and display the main features at the local (centre) and regional (top) level.

### Integrating DEMs
A simple map of the region of Nasca, Peru incorporating a DEM downloaded from INGEMMET (Peru). Inset uses data from the same source but represents political administrative units.

### Landsat 7 images
This map is based on Landsat 7 imagery with bands reassigning bands (band combination 4, 3, 2) to show the vegetation's extent (in red) in the Nasca area.

### Feature digitisation and Classification
This map shows features from an excavation in Peru. Most features were directly mapped in the field using a GPS/Total Station, the data was stored in a data collector and then transfer to Autocad. Others were digitised from ortho-mosaics produced in the field. Later, features were imported into ArcGIS. In addition, features were classified by field values (i.e., function).
